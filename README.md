# bayesian-ecofin-turning-point-estimation

This project is based on Kaufmann 2010, Dating and Forecasting Turning Points by Bayesian Clustering with Dynamic Structure: A Suggestion with an Application to Austrian Data.


In order to run the code one must go on matlab and run the following lines in the right folder:

run("start_model4_logit")
run("permut_MS_ALL")

And then in order to get the plot one must run:

run("plot_ALL")


The matlab code is an adaptation of the one used in Kaufmann 2010 (http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/jae/2010-v25.2/kaufmann/).

All the data pre processing steps can be found in data_cleaner.py file.
